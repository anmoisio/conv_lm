The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 17.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.7 hours of data, or 0.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (6,20.2,90)
